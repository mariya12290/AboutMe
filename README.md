# AboutMe
I am Surendra Kumar, coming from Bachelors in mechanical engineering to Masters in Commercial Vehicle Technology(major in Robotics). I have worked in different departments both in universities as well as companies to gain both theoretical and practical experience in robotics and programming. I still need to learn lots  of technical concepts along with practical experience. Therefore, I am currently looking for an opportunity. One can verify my work as an algorithm developer for robotics in https://github.com/mariya12290/robotics. To gain theoretical alogn with practical experience in Artifical intelligence, I did my master thesis on "3D object detection with LiDAR in Deep learning". One can verify my work in https://github.com/mariya12290/VoxelNet_MultiClass repository. During my master thesis, I have used different networks such as Pointpillar, Second, PointRCNN. In order to make sure my understanding of deep learning,I even extend models as one can see in https://github.com/mariya12290/VoxelNet_MultiClass.
