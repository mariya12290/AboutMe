An introduction of my work with proven results
I am Surendra Kumar, healing from Bachelors in mechanical to Masters in Commercial Vehicle Technology(major in Robotics). I have worked in different departments both in universities as well as companies to gain both theoretical and practical experience in robotics and programming. I still need tolearn lots  of technical concepts along with practical experience. Therefore, I am currently looking for an opportunity.
